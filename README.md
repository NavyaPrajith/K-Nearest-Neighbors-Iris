This project explores the application of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the renowned Iris dataset. The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepal and petal dimensions for three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

The KNN algorithm works by finding the 'k' nearest data points in the feature space and classifying the input data based on the majority class among its neighbors. In this project, we train the KNN classifier on a subset of the Iris dataset, using features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to predict the species of iris.

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of KNN in classifying iris species accurately. By varying the value of 'k' and evaluating the classifier's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, we gain insights into the impact of different parameter settings on classification outcomes.
